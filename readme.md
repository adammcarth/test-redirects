### test-redirects

> Write automated tests for your redirects.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wayneashleyberry/test-redirects.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wayneashleyberry/test-redirects)

Testing that your web server is configured correctly can be a pain. You want to
make sure your users will always get to the correct content but manually
testing this is slow, tedious and error-prone.

#### Installation

```sh
npm install -g test-redirects
```

#### Usage

```sh
test-redirects
```

`test-directs` will look for a file called `test-redirects.json`, check out the
[example](https://github.com/wayneashleyberry/test-redirects/blob/master/test-redirects.json)
to see what this file should look like.
