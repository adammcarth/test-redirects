Testing that your web server is configured correctly can be a pain. You want to
make sure your users will always get to the correct content but manually
testing this is slow, tedious and error-prone.

#### Installation

```sh
npm install -g test-redirects
```

#### Usage

Create a file named `test-redirects.json`. Check out the example to see how the
data should be structured. The run `test-redirects`, you're done!
